1. polished baseline.(debugging)

2. modified T to find better performance.

3. implemented lexicon substitution using around word to predict target word.

3-1. score calculation method implemented:
(1). distance base (short distance with around word is better)
(2). add method(cos similarity)
(3). baladd method(cos cimilarity)

3-2. implemented finding context words around of the target word.

4. wrote Jupyter notebook
