	when: implementing base line Algorithm: Iterative segmenter,
	what: if we follow the algorithm on hw page, when a unknown word appear, the loop will stop. this cause the segmentation stop in middle
	solve: if we found a unknown word, we make it a independent word in heap, then run loop again

improvement: if there are 2 unknown words in sequence, we make them into one word. 


smoothing: linear interpolation: alpha*pc1 + (1-alpha)*pc2
	pc1 is +1 smoothed unigram
	pc2 is +1 smoothed bigram

	alpha = 0, score = 0.89
	alpha = 0.4, score = 0.9
	alpha = 0.5, score = 0.9
	alpha = 0.8, score = 0.9

impeovement:
	dont segment "·０１２３４５６７８９"
	if there is a unit following the numbers, dont segment it
